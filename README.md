## Test_rimraf

Testing out the node.js package [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf), and [bloging about it](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/05/14/nodejs-rimraf/).

I wrote a post on this back in may of this year (2017), and becuase it seems that it is getting a bit of traffic thought that my post deserves an update, and maybe even a corresponding git hub repo, so here it is.

## Installing the test project

No way am I going to pollute the npmjs name space with this, if you actualy want if for some reason clone it in with git from here.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_rimraf
$ cd test_rimraf
```
